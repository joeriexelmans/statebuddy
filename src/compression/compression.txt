I've tried

  1) JSON -> DEFLATE -> base64
  2) CBOR -> DEFLATE -> base64

and they were roughly equal in size. CBOR beats JSON, but after DEFLATE, CBOR is actually slightly worse!

Switching base64 to base85 is an obvious win, but comes at the risk of breaking browser compatibility.

Swapping out DEFLATE for Brotli brings another 20% advantage, but Brotli's WASM implementation is about ~1MB in size, which is not acceptable.

Hence, I conclude that JSON + DEFLATE + base64 is the "sweet spot":
  - maximally uses browser builtin functions
    -> small bundle size
    -> efficient implementation
  - decent compression sizes
