Language features
    abstract syntax
        - and/or states
        - pseudo-states
        - enter/exit trigger
        - shallow/deep history
        - transitions
            - event/after trigger
            - event parameters
            - guard expressions
        - action language
            expressions:
                - arithmetic, logic
                - variable references
                - function calls
            actions:
                - variable assignment
                - raising output events
    semantics
        - omniscient debugging
        - recording and replaying traces
        - time:
            - paused / step-wise
            - (scaled) real time
        - interactively raising input events
        - coupled execution with "plant"
            - 3 hardcoded plants
        - MTL property checking

Editor features
    - select/move/resize
        Shift key to grow selection
    - copy/paste
    - rotate
    - find & replace

App features
    - light/dark mode

Performance
    - spatial hashing to speed up 'connectness' and 'insideness' detection
    - very fast loading (especially compared to yakindu...)


TODO

- bugs
    (*) editing SC <-> Plant connections at runtime doesn't seem to work
    (*) runtime errors coming from plant are mistakenly shown as runtime errors on statechart
    (*) runtime errors during initialization do not appear in trace
    (*) when dragging shapes in 'huge' example while zoomed out, they move too much (but not in other examples??)

- maybe support:
    - explicit order of outgoing transitions?
    - (Rust) code generator?

- write documentation
    although ideally the tool should explain itself...

- usability stuff:
    - traffic light plant: turn state of 'police interrupt' button into a signal
    - make side panel user-resizable
    - use smaller margin for selecting endpoint of arrow?
        (right now, often one will select the side of a rountangle but not the arrow connecting to it)
    - action language: add increment operations (++) and (--)
       and (+=) and (-=)
    - snap:
            comments only to states
            triggers only to transitions
            entry/exit only to states
    - ability to hide statechart and only show the plant?    
    - rename events / variables?
    - hovering over error in bottom panel should highlight that error in the SC
    - hovering over event in side panel should highlight all occurrences of the event in the SC
    - highlight about-to-fire transitions
    - integrate undo-history with browser history (back/forward buttons)
    - ability to 'freeze' editor (e.g., to show plant SC)
    - show insert mode also next to cursor
    - show error when states partially overlap?
        useful when accidentally pasting the same data multiple times
            (otherwise, you can't see that you have multiple states)

- extensibility
    - support 3rd party "plants"
        how to implement this? dynamically load JS module?

- performance:
    maybe try this for rendering the execution trace:
        https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#virtualize-long-lists

- experimental features:
    - multiverse execution history
        stable tree layout?
            https://pub.dev/packages/ploeg_tree_layout
    - local variable scopes

Breaking changes (after mosis25 is finished):
    - state names start with # (not with //)

    semantic versioning?

Publish StateBuddy paper(s):
    compare CS approach to other tools, not only YAKINDU
